# Django AllAuth Simple Authentication

A simple repo showing how to integrate Django and Django-AllAuth without exteral social integration, this is a great way to support simple blogs or a internal company website.

If you wish to integrate Django and Django-AllAuth with Github, LinkedIn, Facebook and Google you can take a look at my other Django implementation on my github page, or on my [blog](https://blog.mustansirg.in)

You can also learn how to make certain endpoints available only when users are logged in and redirect when they aren't.

The templates in this file have been copied from the allauth repository and can be edited to each's need.

I've used very basic bootstrap4 css for the login pages and they don't look very nice either. To use better and more custom css take a look at some of my other implementations using providers with django-allauth(coming soon).
