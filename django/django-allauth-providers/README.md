# Django AllAuth Provider Authentication Examples

In this repo you can learn to integrate django-allauth into your application with support for login with github, google, facebook and every provider allauth supports, you can also view the correspoding youtube video to learn how I do so. 

This is a great repository to use for creating a personal blog or your company website/portfolio. If you wish to have even more control over the login process you can try a provider like keycloak or something like authlib that's even more flexible.
