# Django AllAuth Simple Authentication

A simple repo showing how to integrate Django and Django-AllAuth without exteral social integration, this is a great way to support simple blogs or a internal company website.

If you wish to integrate Django and Django-AllAuth with Github, LinkedIn, Facebook and Google you can take a look at my other Django implementation in this repository itself. 

You can also learn how to make certain endpoints available only when users are logged in and redirect when they aren't.

The templates in this file have been copied from the allauth repository and can be edited to each's need.
